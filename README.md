# Shopping-cart-application
Computer Programming project from my first semester.

<h3>Modules to be installed </h3>
customtkinter <br>
pillow <br>
packaging <br><br>

This can be accomplished by executing the "Install-prerequisites.bat" file <br>

<h3>Manager App authentication </h3>
Since the password is hashed this is the only way you can know <br>
Manager ID : 420818 , Password : kdkdkdkd <br>

<h3> User App authentication </h3>
Pre-made user:<br>
Username: Hanslace<br>
Password: tyty<br>

<br>There is no user logged in at the start so you are free to make a new account<br>
<br>The application is not responsive, so if you open it on a smaller screen, some options may get hidden<br>
<br>On removal of login page, an error occurs in terminal, please disregard this since it is an internal error of customtkinter library<br>
<br>Enjoy (:
